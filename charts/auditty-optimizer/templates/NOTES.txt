Thank you for installing Auditty.

Some important notes about the prerequisites:

1. The secret `{{ .Values.secret.name }}` must exist in the `auditty` namespace with the following data:
    ```yaml
    data:
      auditty-license-key: <key>
      org-name: <name>
      org-unit: <name>
      env-name: <name>
    ```

2. If you choose to have Helm generate the secret for you, make sure to use the following flags when installing the Helm chart:
    ```sh
    --namespace auditty --create-namespace
    ```

3. The ConfigMap needs to follow this structure:
    ```yaml
    data:
      cluster-name: <anyNameYouWantToUse>
      exclude-namespaces: |
        - list-of-namespaces-to-always-ignore
      exclude-pods: |
        - pod-prefix-to-always-ignore
      include-logs: |
        - log-substring-to-always-pass-as-is
      exclude-logs: |
        - log-substring-to-always-drop (this takes precedence over 'include')
    ```

4. A healthy DaemonSet generally indicates that the setup is good to go. Errors are logged, but no further action is typically required.

5. You can scrape port `2112` for `/metrics`.

Optimized!
